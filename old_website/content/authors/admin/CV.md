I am the Magerman Term Assistant Professor of [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania. I am associated with the [theory group](http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/), the [ASSET Center](https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineerings-new-asset-center-will-focus-on-the-safety-explainability-and-trustworthiness-of-ai-systems/) on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems, and the [Warren Center](https://warrencenter.upenn.edu/) for network and data sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning, with a focus on developing theoretical foundations for modern machine learning paradigms, particularly deep learning. My group's research is genererously supported by Microsoft Research and OpenAI.

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research NYC in the Machine Learning group. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin where I was fortunate to be advised by [Adam Klivans](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/klivans/). My dissertation was awarded UTCS's Bert Kay Dissertation award, and my Ph.D. research was generously supported by the JP Morgan AI Fellowship and fellowships from UT Austin. During my PhD, I visited IAS at Princeton and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley (supported by the Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship). Before that, I received my Bachelors degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.

I am actively involved in service and outreach roles. Along with [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/) and [Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io/), I co-founded [Learning Theory Alliance (LeT‐All)](https://www.let-all.com), a community building and mentorship initiative for the learning theory community. I am currently serving as the Office Hours co-chair for ICLR 2024, co-treasurer for the Association for Computational Learning Theory, and on the steering committee for the Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory. *I am currently visiting the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley in the role of a co‐organizer for the [Special Year on Large Language Models](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/special-year-large-language-models-transformers-part-1).*

**Students**: I currently advise [Ezra Edelman](https://www.ezraedelman.com/) (they/them). I am fortunate to also collaborate with several undergraduate, masters, and PhD students at UPenn who I do not directly advise.

**Teaching**: In Spring 2023 and 2024, I co-taught [CIS 5200: Machine Learning](https://machine-learning-upenn.github.io/) with [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/). In Fall 2023, I taught a special topics course [CIS 7000: Foundations of Modern Machine Learning: Theory and Empirics](https://surbhi18.github.io/FoMML/). .

**For prospective students who are interested in working with me:** Please apply to the [CIS PhD program](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/how-to-apply/) and list me as a potential advisor. Unfortunately I will not be able to respond to individual emails from prospective PhD applicants at this time. If you are a current UPenn student looking to do an independent research project, send me an email with your CV, an overview of your research interests, and a brief description of 1-2 recent papers (not necessarily mine) you have read and enjoyed. I do not have any current opportunities for external students.

I started (and never updated) a blog: [Unproven Algorithms](https://unprovenalgos.github.io/).
