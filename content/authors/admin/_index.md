I am a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research NYC in the Machine Learning group. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin advised by Adam Klivans. Prior to that, I received my Bachelors degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of theory and machine learning. I am particularly excited about building theoretical foundations of deep learning.
