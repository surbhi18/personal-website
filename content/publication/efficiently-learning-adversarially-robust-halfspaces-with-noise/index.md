abstract: We study the problem of learning adversarially robust halfspaces in
  the distribution-independent setting. In the realizable setting, we provide
  necessary and sufficient conditions on the adversarial perturbation sets under
  which halfspaces are efficiently robustly learnable. In the presence of random
  label noise, we give a simple computationally efficient algorithm for this
  problem with respect to any â„“p-perturbation.
