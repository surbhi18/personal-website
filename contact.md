**For prospective students who are interested in working with me:** Please apply to the [CIS PhD program](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/how-to-apply/) and list me as a potential advisor. Unfortunately I will not be able to respond to individual emails from prospective PhD applicants at this time. If you are a current Penn student looking to do an independent research project, send me an email with your CV, an overview of your research interests, and a brief description of 1-2 recent papers (not necessarily mine) you have read and enjoyed. _I do not have any current opportunities for external students._
