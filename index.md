    <p>I am the Magerman Term Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Computer and Information Science</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am affiliated with the <a href="http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/">Theory group</a>, the <a href="https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/">ASSET Center</a> on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems, and the <a href="https://warrencenter.upenn.edu/">Warren Center</a> for network and data sciences. 
    </p>
    <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning, with a focus on developing theoretical foundations for modern machine learning paradigms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before joining Penn, I was a postdoc at Microsoft Research NYC in the Machine Learning group. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/klivans/">Adam Klivans</a>. During my PhD, I visited IAS at Princeton and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley. Prior to that, I received my Bachelors degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.
