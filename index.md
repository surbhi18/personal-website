    <p>I am the Magerman Term Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">Computer and Information Science</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am affiliated with the <a href="http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/">Theory group</a>, the <a href="https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/">ASSET Center</a> on safe, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems, and the <a href="https://warrencenter.upenn.edu/">Warren Center</a> for network and data sciences. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning, with a focus on developing theoretical foundations for modern machine learning paradigms. My group's research is generously supported by grants from Microsoft Research and OpenAI.</p>

    <p>Before joining Penn, I was a postdoc at Microsoft Research NYC in the Machine Learning group. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/klivans/">Adam Klivans</a>. My thesis was awarded the Bert Kay Dissertation award by the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, and my Ph.D. research was generously supported by the JP Morgan AI Fellowship and the Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship. During my PhD, I visited IAS at Princeton and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley. Prior to that, I received my Bachelors degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.</p>
